Handlebars Tutor Project

Handlebars introduction

Handlebars provides the power necessary to let you build semantic templates effectively with no frustration.
Mustache templates are compatible with Handlebars, so you can take a Mustache template, import it into Handlebars, and start taking advantage of the extra Handlebars features.

Getting Started
In this tutorial, you will learn to use handlebars from begining, including expressions, precompilation, block expressions, block helpers, with, each, if, unless, handlerpbars paths, and user defined helpers.
